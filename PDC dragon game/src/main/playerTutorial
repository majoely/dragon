Welcome to the world and your dragon.
Here is a brief run down of the commands currently available to you
in the player menu
"help" - Displays the commands for the menu you are in
"name" - Displays your name
"pack" - Takes you to the pack menu where you can buy, sell and use items
"dragon" - Takes you to the dragon menu where you can interact with your dragon
"quests" - Takes you to your quest ledger, this is where you can check up on your

Your goal for the game is to become king of the land of Awesome. You will do
do this by raising your dragon into a killing machine. To start with you will
only have a few actions available to start raising your dragon. Start with
those and soon you will be able to start going on quests and start fighting
your foes.
